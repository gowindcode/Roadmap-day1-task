            <p><b>Father of HTML</b></p>
            <p>HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol and it is the basis for almost all web applications.</p>
            <span>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, OM, KBE, FRS, FREng, FRSA, DFBCS, RDI (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an 
                English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, the HTML markup language, the URL system, 
                and HTTP.</span>

            <p>HTTP/2 is different from HTTP/1 in several ways, including supporting server push, multiplexing of requests, and header 
                compression. HTTP/2 also uses binary encoding rather than text encoding, making it more efficient. A: Most modern web browsers,
                 including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, support HTTP/2</p>

            <img src="./Assets/Brendan Eichs.jpg" alt="Brendan Eich"/>
            <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. 
                After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.</p>

            <h3>Objects in Javascript</h3>
            <img src="./Assets/objects in js dtl.jpg" alt="objs"/>
            <p class="left">	
                Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
                Java script code sample:<br>
                let bike = { <br>
                    name : "Appachi", <br>
                    capacity : "200 CC", <br>
                    brand : "TVS", <br>
                    awards : "Best in Racing Class", <br>
                    displayinfo : function(){ <br>
                        console.log(`${bike.name} is best <br>
                          in ${company.capacity} class and ${company.brand}  <br>
                          acheived top rating in ${company.awards});

            <h2>Web Browsers Engines</h2>
            <img src="./Assets/webbrowsers.jpg" alt="webbrs"/>
            <h4>Web Browsers consist of 7 different components listed below:</h4>
            <br>
            <p><b>1. User Interface</b>
            This component allows end-users to interact with all visual elements available on the web page. The visual elements include the address bar, home button, next button, and all other elements that fetch and display the web page requested by the end-user.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>2. Browser Engine</b>
            It is a core component of every web browser. The browser engine functions as an intermediary or a bridge between the user interface and the rendering engine. It queries and handles the rendering engine as per the inputs received from the user interface.
            The performance and features of a browser engine can greatly impact the user experience of a web browser. A fast and efficient browser engine can help web pages load quickly and smoothly, while a slower or less capable engine may struggle to render complex pages or provide a smooth browsing experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>3. Rendering Engine</b>
            As the name suggests, this component is responsible for rendering a specific web page requested by the user on their screen. It interprets HTML and XML documents along with images that are styled or formatted using CSS, and a final layout is generated, which is displayed on the user interface.
            Note: Every browser has its own unique rendering engine. Rendering engines might also differ for different browser versions. The list below mentions browser engines used by a few common browsers:</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>4.Networking</b>
                This component is responsible for managing network calls using standard protocols like HTTP or FTP. It also looks after security issues associated with internet communication.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>5. JavaScript Interpreter</b>
                As the name suggests, it is responsible for parsing and executing the JavaScript code embedded in a website. Once the interpreted results are generated, they are forwarded to the rendering engine for display on the user interface.</p>
            <br>    
            <p><b>6. UI Backend</b>
                This component uses the user interface methods of the underlying operating system. It is mainly used for drawing basic widgets (windows and combo boxes).</p>
            <br>    
            <p><b>7. Data Storage/Persistence</b>
                It is a persistent layer. A web browser needs to store various types of data locally, for example, cookies. As a result, browsers must be compatible with data storage mechanisms such as WebSQL, IndexedDB, FileSystem, etc.
                Now that we are aware of the key components involved in building a web browser lets dig deep into the role of the rendering engine.</p>

            <p> <b>About IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address</b>
                <br><br>
                If we want to call some one in crowd, we should call with particular name or identity.
                Here in networks having lots of things inside, so if we want to call or search about guvi home page we should type guvi in browser search bar, 
                so suddenly network work browser search the guvi with particular reference via numbers. This is called IP address (8bits)
                <br>
                An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is connected to a computer network that uses the Internet 
                Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: network interface identification, and location addressing.
                <br>
                All the computers of the world on the Internet network communicate with each other with underground or underwater cables or wirelessly. If I want 
                to download a file from the internet or load a web page or literally do anything related to the internet, my computer must have an address so that 
                other computers can find and locate mine in order to deliver that particular file or webpage that I am requesting. In technical terms, that address 
                is called IP Address or Internet Protocol Address.
                <br>
                Let us understand it with another example, like if someone wants to send you a mail then he/she must have your home address. Similarly, your computer
                too needs an address so that other computers on the internet can communicate with each other without the confusion of delivering information to someone
                elses computer. And that is why each computer in this world has a unique IP Address. Or in other words, an IP address is a unique address that is used
                to identify computers or nodes on the internet. This address is just a string of numbers written in a certain format. It is generally expressed in a set
                of numbers for example 192.155.12.1. Here each number in the set is from 0 to 255 range. Or we can say that a full IP address ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 
                255.255.255.255. And these IP addresses are assigned by IANA (known as Internet Corporation For Internet Assigned Numbers Authority). 
                But what is Internet protocol? This is just a set of rules that makes the internet work. You are able to read this article because your computer or phone 
                has a unique address where the page that you requested has been delivered successfully.
                <br>
                <b>Working of IP addresses</b>
                The working of IP addresses is similar to other languages. It can also use some set of rules to send information. Using these protocols we can easily send,
                 and receive data or files to the connected devices. There are several steps behind the scenes. Let us look at them 
                •	Your device directly requests your Internet Service Provider which then grants your device access to the web.
                •	And an IP Address is assigned to your device from the given range available.
                •	Your internet activity goes through your service provider, and they route it back to you, using your IP address.
                •	Your IP address can change. For example, turning your router on or off can change your IP Address.
                •	When you are out from your home location your home IP address does not accompany you. It changes as you change the network of your device.
                <br>
                <b>Types of IP Address</b>
                IP Address is of two types: 
                <br>
                <b>1. IPv4: Internet Protocol version 4.</b> <br>
                It consists of 4 numbers separated by the dots. Each number can be from 0-255 in decimal numbers. But computers do 
                not understand decimal numbers, they instead change them to binary numbers which are only 0 and 1. Therefore, in binary, this (0-255) range can be written as 
                (00000000 -- 11111111). Since each number N can be represented by a group of 8-digit binary digits. So, a whole IPv4 binary address can be represented by 32-bits 
                of binary digits. In IPv4, a unique sequence of bits is assigned to a computer, so a total of (2^32) devices approximately = 4,294,967,296 can be assigned with IPv4. 
                <br>
                <b>IPv4 can be written as:</b>
                189.123.123.90
                <br>
                Classes of IPv4 Address: There are around 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses and managing all those addresses without any scheme is next to impossible. Lets understand it 
                with a simple example. If you have to find a word from a language dictionary, how long will it take? Usually, you will take less than 5 minutes to find that word. 
                You are able to do this because words in the dictionary are organized in alphabetical order. If you have to find out the same word from a dictionary that doesnt use 
                any sequence or order to organize the words, it will take an eternity to find the word. If a dictionary with one billion words without order can be so disastrous, 
                then you can imagine the pain behind finding an address from 4.3 billion addresses. For easier management and assignment IP addresses are organized in numeric order 
                and divided into the following 5 classes :
